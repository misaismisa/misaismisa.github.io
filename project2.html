            <p><b>Yelp</b> was the obvious choice as the top competitor. It’s branding and presence among users is widely known and people use the service to search for everything. It’s positioned itself at the top and is backed by its number of reviews and the number of businesses on its application. It does face issues of review manipulation and poses a threat to smaller businesses. <b>StyleSeat</b> and <b>Vagaro</b> were chosen for their focus on beauty-related services. These two services are direct threats to a potential application but the lack of market presence still leaves room for opportunity. They both have a unique design and booking features.</p>

          <p>Using brainstorming techniques of <b>mind-mapping and word lists</b>, I tried various combinations of words related to beauty that could be used as a brand name. After much deliberation, the word ‘Lure’ as a spinoff of ‘Allure’ was the most attractive as a name that was unique and trendy.</p>

          <p>Defining and designing a logo to accompany “Lure” proved to be quite a challenge. I originally wanted a logo that <b>wasn’t painfully obvious</b> in regards to beauty related services, such as a “pair of scissors” or a “lip”. I chose an eye originally thinking that it could be somewhat gender neutral but received mixed feedback on the iterations I had. After consideration,  I decided to scrap the existing logos and chose to refine the word itself and came up with a colorful “Lure” logo design.</p>

          <p>Looking at my competitors, I wanted to deviate from red (Yelp), a bright mint green (StyleSeat), and a coral (Vagaro), but didn’t want ‘pink’ as an obvious choice of color. With my mood-board as my inspiration, I drew my <b>organic pastel mints, peach</b> and grey tones to create a luxurious look. I later ran into complications when implementing only the top 3 colors and realized I needed various shades of each to help contrast. </p>

           <p>With sketching, I was able to flesh out the basic framework of how I wanted my screens to look.  I then used <b>Figma</b>, to build out my <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/MSj8xQfkhTUyM6ub2">digital iterations</a>, I knew that compared to my first project, taking the time to structurally compose each part would save me a lot of time when it came to my high-fidelity mockups. With 43 screens, I was able to build out the main screens for each user flow action. I realized that for certain components, I needed to make sure I understood <b>Apple’s HIG</b> and often toggled back and forth between it’s UI library to copy some of it’s features.</p>
           <p>With testing I took a fun approach and made a nifty, <b>cardboard cutout</b> of a “phone” and printed out my digital wireframes. I then tested the wireframes by having the users slide the screens behind the cutout or tap with their finger and I would switch out screens. This really put into perspective the simplicity in which the user needed to interact with the layout of the application, especially when I had my <b>8-year old niece</b> test.</p>

          <p>Putting together a tappable prototype via <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/MSj8xQfkhTUyM6ub2">Marvel</a>, I connected it with <a href="https://t.maze.design/591666">Maze</a> to have remote users test for the 4 tasks I had developed earlier. <b>1) As a new user, search for a hair salon and review its information 2) Sign-up for a new account and book the first appointment 3) Leave a review on a past appointment as a returning user 4) Look at bookmarks and notifications</b>. I also tested on 2 live users in-person to see the actual flow and structural integrity of the application. <br><br>I received significant <b>feedback</b> which included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Making the user to have to tap on category filters before selecting the first choice salon, made it confusing when I was giving brief instructions</li>
              <li>Some users felt it made more sense to tap on the stylist to review their information before selecting a time</li>
              <li>Leaving a review was confusing for users because they had multiple routes they could have gone down when I had one option for them to select</li>
              <li>Making “Reviews” a major component of the navigation and merging “Home” and “Search” as one</li>
              <li>Having the user with the option to “Logout” from the new user stage, would have made for an easier transition into logging in as a ‘returning user’ to complete certain tasks</li>
              <li>Greying out certain elements on the page would have it made more clear to the user on how to approach certain tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Taking this feedback in mind, I went back to my mockups and edited the booking section to have a <b>separate stylist page</b> which would show the options for time under each individual. I did a overhaul on my navigation and assessed which tasks were most important, <b>eliminating “home” so that “search”</b> could be the main home nav component and adding in “reviews” as a navigation option. I also assessed how complicated my prototype was and made sure to <b>simplify the flow</b> for the user.</p>

           <p>With this project being my second run, it taught me some valuable lessons as I progressed in my abilities to conduct research, analyze, test, and design.</p>

           <p>
            <span class="subtitle"><b>+ Stick to your target.</b></span><br><br>
            Nothing proves more true when you’re working through research or design and a wrench is thrown in to leave you confused and back at square one. This was the case when I was coming up with a logo design and received varying feedback on my designs.  I changed my audience to be more inclusive towards the opposite sex and felt that I had to create a logo that was “neutral” in a sense, but felt lost when I was drafting up versions with barber-related symbols. I needed to remind myself that my original intention was to have women as my target audience and create the best MVP possible. I could then later adjust what is now my “Lure” logo to have colors that were less “feminine” and more vibrant to match a more gender-neutral audience. </p>
            <p>
            <span class="subtitle"><b>- Don’t spend time on screens you won’t be using</b></span><br><br>
            As I design my high-fidelity mockups, I often realize, “Oh wait! I also need to design these screens, otherwise the users will feel like they have suddenly jumped from one to another.” However, this can also lead me down a rabbit hole, chasing after other screens on my application that aren’t necessary to the user tasks that I want my users to test. Knowing that in the future, I won’t have the luxury of time, I have to learn to scale back the amount of time spent on designing my mockups, putting together the necessary screens for my prototype, and learning my tools thoroughly to save me from pixel pushing every single pixel, every screen at a time.</p>
            <p>
            <span class="subtitle"><b>With more time...</b></span><br><br>
            I would like to build out a basic information screen that the first-time user would have to fill out before booking an appointment. I realized that the application wouldn’t have any information on the user unless it grabbed data from another application. Conducting more research on “map” versus “list” presentation would also be useful in figuring out what was important to the user, as well as whether having one icon, a “heart”, to represent bookmarks and starred would be more effective than separating the two into different categories.</p>
